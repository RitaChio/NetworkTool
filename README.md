# Network Web API Tool

This is a website I am working on that will analyze various features of the network, 
including the WLAN, LAN, WAN, ISP, speed test, latency, and any other valuable 
data in real time. It will have user input boxes which will allow users to input 
IP adresses, ISPs and other companies to find the coverage areas/territories, etc. 

This is intended to be a personal experimental learning project of mine as I grow 
accustomed to various protocols and network technologies across the OSI model.
